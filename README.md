# Common Types

The Common Types repository provides a collection of commonly used geometry types for various applications. These types are defined using the `Boost.Geometry` library, offering flexibility and functionality for geometric calculations and manipulations.

It is intended to be used in ROS Projects and therefore contains a `package.xml` file. But it is also possible to use this in a pure cmake project. This project exports the `dsd_common_types::dsd_common_types` target, which other projects can link against.
